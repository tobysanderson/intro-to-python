## Scrambled Eggs

**Ingredients:**
- 2-3 eggs
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon butter or cooking oil
- Optional toppings: shredded cheese, chopped herbs, diced vegetables

**Instructions:**
1. Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them until the yolks and whites are well combined. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add the butter or cooking oil. Allow it to melt and coat the bottom of the skillet.
3. Pour the beaten eggs into the skillet and let them cook undisturbed for a few seconds until the edges start to set.
4. Gently stir the eggs with a spatula, breaking them up into curds. Continue stirring occasionally until the eggs are mostly set but still slightly runny.
5. Remove the skillet from the heat while the eggs finish cooking from the residual heat. Stir a few more times to evenly distribute the heat.
6. Transfer the scrambled eggs to a plate and let them rest for a minute to finish cooking.
7. Sprinkle with your choice of optional toppings, such as shredded cheese, chopped herbs, or diced vegetables.
8. Serve the scrambled eggs while still warm. Enjoy!

Note: Feel free to adjust the number of eggs and seasoning according to your preference.
